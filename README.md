# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an online shopping platform.
## Description:
With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hopping to promote social distancing by
allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside. The plateform
itself will allow its user to purchase/sell various different items. The webiste has five 
aisles of fruits, vegetables, bakery products, dairy products and meat products. Then we 
have cart page where user can see the items which he has added and can procede for 
checkout from there. For back-end user/admin we have add item page from where admin can 
edit items on website. Then we also have edit order page from where admin can chage the 
orders on request of user. We can also have login and sign-up page which redirect admin
and user to there pages.
