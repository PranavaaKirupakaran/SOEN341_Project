# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an e-commerce platform.
## Description:
With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hopping to promote social distancing by
allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside. The plateform
itself will allow its user to purchase/sell various different items. The user will have the
oppurtunity to purchase a variety of different items such as books, apparel, electronics etc.
The user will be able to add the desired items into a cart and proceed to purchase the items
from there. Furthermore, the website will have a login and sign-up page for the different 
users of the plateform.
## Core Features:
- Add/Remove items from a cart
- Search bar to quickly find the desired item
- Sort through the item by ascending/descending price
- Login and sign up page
- Sellers/Admin can remove/add items to the plateform
- Admin can edit/cancel orders after purchase
- Star based review systems and comment sections

## Project Approach: 
    In order to complete this project, we had to assess and understand the strength of everyone. We were able to distribute the roles depending on each one of usâ€™ strength in order to make the most out of the team that we have. We concluded that we had to meet three times a week in order to make sure the program is progressing at a correct pace, and to make sure that we would be able to share the skills and knowledge acquired during our time programming. At each meeting, we will make sure that all team members are up to date on their tasks, and it will be the opportunity to ask for help if needed. We want to always be ahead of the schedule in case a major problem occurs. We want our meeting to follow a specific format. Twice a week we will meet for a small time period where we will update our team on our progress and at the end of the week, we will organise a long meeting where everyone shows and share their thoughts, ideas, concerns and progress in order to maximise our learning and understanding opportunities. We also use this opportunity to establish the task for the next week in order to stay ahead of the curve.
