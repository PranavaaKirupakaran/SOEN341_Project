# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an e-commerce platform.
## Description:
    With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
    virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hoping to promote social distancing by
    allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside of retail stores 
    and be at risk to contract COVID-19. The plateform itself will allow its users to purchase/sell 
    various different items, such as books, apparel, electronics etc. The user will be able to add the 
    desired items into his cart and proceed to purchase the items from there with his preffered payment
    method. Furthermore, the website will have a sign-up and login page for the different users of the 
    plateform.
## Core Features:
- Add/Remove items from a cart
- Search bar to quickly find the desired item
- Sort through the item by ascending/descending price
- Login and sign up page
- Sellers/Admin can remove/add items to the plateform
- Admin can edit/cancel orders after purchase
- Star based review systems and comment sections

## Project Approach: 
    In order to complete this project, we had to assess and understand the strength of everyone.
    We were able to distribute the roles depending on each one of usâ€™ strength in order to make 
    the most out of the team that we have. We concluded that we had to meet three times a week 
    in order to make sure the program is progressing at a correct pace, and to make sure that 
    we would be able to share the skills and knowledge acquired during our time programming.
    At each meeting, we will make sure that all team members are up to date on their tasks, 
    and it will be the opportunity to ask for help if needed. We want to always be ahead 
    of the schedule in case a major problem occurs. We want our meeting to follow a specific
    format. Once a week we will meet for a small time period where we will update our team
    on our progress and at the end of the week, we will organise a long meeting where everyone 
    shows and share their thoughts, ideas, concerns and progress in order to maximise our 
    learning and understanding opportunities. We also use this opportunity to establish the
    task for the next week in order to stay ahead of the curve.We have decided to go for Javascript 
    as the front end language and php for the backend. Javascript is a staple for front end and we 
    have decided to go with PHP as most of our team members had some knowledge of the technology. 
## Technologies:
- Javascript
- PHP
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- VSCODE
