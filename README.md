# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an online shopping platform.
## Description:
With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hopping to promote social distancing by
allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside. The plateform
itself will allow its user to purchase/sell various different items.
