# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an e-commerce platform.
## Description:
With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hoping to promote social distancing by
allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside of retail stores and be at risk to contract COVID-19. The plateform
itself will allow its users to purchase/sell various different items, such as books, apparel, electronics etc.
The user will be able to add the desired items into his cart and proceed to purchase the items
from there with his preffered payment method. Furthermore, the website will have a sign-up and login page for the different users of the plateform.
## Core Features:
- Add/Remove items from a cart
- Search bar to quickly find the desired item
- Sort through the item by ascending/descending price
- Login and sign up page
- Sellers/Admin can remove/add items to the plateform
- Admin can edit/cancel orders after purchase
- Star based review systems and comment sections
