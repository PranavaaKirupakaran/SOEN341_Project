# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an e-commerce platform.
## Description:
With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hopping to promote social distancing by
allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside. The plateform
itself will allow its user to purchase/sell various different items. The user will have the
oppurtunity to purchase a variety of different items such as books, apparel, electronics etc.
The user will be able to add the desired items into a cart and proceed to purchase the items
from there. Furthermore, the website will have a login and sign-up page for the different 
users of the plateform.
## Core Features:
- Add/Remove items from a cart
- Search bar to quickly find the desired item
- Sort through the item by ascending/descending price
- Login and sign up page
- Sellers/Admin can remove/add items to the plateform
- Admin can edit/cancel orders after purchase
