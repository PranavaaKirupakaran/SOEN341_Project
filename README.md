# Team Q SOEN341_Project
## Objective:
Develop an online shopping platform.
## Description:
With the on-going pandemic, social distancing is a must to prevent the propagation of the
virus. With this online shopping plateform we are hopping to promote social distancing by
allowing the people to shop online instead of waiting in long lines outside. The plateform
itself will allow its user to purchase/sell various different items. The user will have the
oppurtunity to purchase a variety of different items such as books, apparel, electronics etc.
The user will be able to add the desired items into a cart and proceed to purchase the items
from there. Furthermore, the webiste will have a login and sign-up page for the different 
users of the plateform.

The webiste has five  aisles of fruits, vegetables, bakery products, dairy products and meat
products. Then we have cart page where user can see the items which he has added and can 
procede for checkout from there. For back-end user/admin we have add item page from where 
admin can edit items on website. Then we also have edit order page from where admin can chage 
the orders on request of user. We can also have login and sign-up page which redirect admin
and user to there pages.
