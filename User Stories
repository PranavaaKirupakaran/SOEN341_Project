1. As a user I want to be able to search for the products using a search bar so that I can quickly find the product that I want without having to scroll through all the posted products and waste my time looking for that product.
2. As a user I want to be able to remove a product from my cart so that if I added a product by mistake or if I decided that I did not want to purchase the product anymore I can easily remove it from my cart without having to do my grocery shopping all over again.
